Textbook recommendations: (switching)? 
TLDR: textbooks should display according to id as specified in the String _bookOrdering of each user. 

"Ordering": The order of which the textbooks are shown to the user when he browses the textbook catalogue of 382 books. 
	Top recommendations are shown to the user first. 

a) Ordering is done by Python backend. 
	i) Inputs: User Id, String of all interests, String of _eventLatest(nullable), String of _eventPrev(nullable)
	ii) Outputs, void. Calls API to store String of bookOrdering
	
b)i) General ordering(null _eventLatest and null _eventPrev): Interests picked by the user determine the basic ordering of textbook
	-2 users who picked the same interests (and has not joined any events) have the same ordering
	-if there are no interests: 
		-order is by i)Alphabetical ordering of genre ii)Alphabetical ordering of textbook title
	-if there are interests: 
		-display books that fall under this genre 
			-likewise order is by i)Alphabetical ordering of genre ii)Alphabetical ordering of textbook title
		-then, display books that do not fall under this genre 
			-likewise order is by i)Alphabetical ordering of genre ii)Alphabetical ordering of textbook title
	
b)ii) Specific recommendations + ordering(_eventLatest and/or _eventPrev has value): 
	-Use cosine similarity/tdtif to get most similar textbooks(compared with title + description)
	-Top 5(?) books to be shown first based on cosine similarity 
	-Reminding books to follow order b) (interests)
