        "description": "Introduction to Sociology - 3e aligns to the topics and objectives of many introductory sociology courses. It is arranged in a manner that provides foundational sociological theories and contexts, then progresses through various aspects of human and societal interactions. The new edition is focused on driving meaningful and memorable learning experiences related to critical thinking about society and culture. The text includes comprehensive coverage of core concepts, discussions and data relevant to a diverse audience, and features that draw learners into the discipline in powerful and personal ways. Overall, Introduction to Sociology 3e aims to center the course and discipline as crucial elements for understanding relationships, society, and civic engagement; the authors seek to lay the foundation for students to apply what they learn throughout their lives and careers.\n\nThe authors, reviewers, and the entire team worked to build understanding of the causes and impacts of discrimination and prejudice. Introduction to Sociology 3e contains dozens of examples of discrimination and its outcomes regarding social science, society, institutions, and individuals. The text seeks to strike a balance between confronting the damaging aspects of our culture and history and celebrating those who have driven change and overcome challenges. The core discussion of these topics are present in Chapter 11 on Race and Ethnicity, and Chapter 12 on Gender, Sex, and Sexuality, but their causes and effects are extensively discussed in the context of other topics, including education, law enforcement, government, healthcare, the economy, and so on. Together and when connected by an instructor, these elements have potential for deep and lasting effects.",

Many laboratory synthesis reactions are also covered, generally in parallel with their biochemical counterparts - but it is intentionally the biological chemistry that comes first.",

The book works for both basic courses for students who do not necessarily wish to go to graduate school and also more advanced courses that prepare students for graduate study and cover topics such as metric spaces. A prerequisite for the course is a basic proof course. This book starts with analysis on the real line, going through sequences, series, and then into continuity, the derivative, and the Riemann integral using the Darboux approach. There are plenty of available detours along the way, or you can power through toward the metric spaces in chapter 7. The philosophy is that metric spaces are absorbed much better by the students after they have gotten comfortable with basic analysis techniques in the very concrete setting of the real line. As a bonus, the book can be used both by slower-paced, more concrete courses, as well as a faster-paced, more abstract courses for future graduate students.",

Irvine (edited by Lyryx Learning) provides concise yet complete coverage of introductory microeconomic theory, application and policy. The text begins with an explanation and development of the standard tools of analysis in the discipline and carries on to investigate the meaning of 'well-being' in the context of an efficient use of the economy's resources. An understanding of individual optimizing behaviour is developed, and this behaviour is in turn used to link household decisions on savings with firms' decisions on production, expansion and investment. The text then explores behaviour in a variety of different market structures. The role of the government is examined, and the key elements in the modern theory of international trade are developed. Opportunity cost, a global economy and behavioural responses to incentives are the dominant themes. Examples are domestic and international in their subject matter and are of the modern era. This text is intended for a one-semester course, and can be used in a two-semester sequence with the companion text, Macroeconomics: Theory, Markets, and Policy. The three introductory chapters and the International Trade chapter (Chapter 15) are common to both books.\n",

Irvine (edited by Lyryx Learning) provides complete, concise coverage of introductory macroeconomics theory and policy. The text observes short-run macroeconomic performance, analysis, and policy motivated by the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s, the financial crisis and recession of 2008-2009, and the prolonged recovery in most industrial countries. A traditional Aggregate Demand and Supply (AD-AS) model is introduced, and a basic modern AD-AS model is developed. Numerical examples, diagrams, and basic algebra are used in combination to illustrate and explain economic relationships. Students learn about: the importance of trade flows, consumption, and government budgets; money supply; financial asset prices, yields, and interest rates; employment and unemployment; and other key relationships in the economy. Canadian and selected international data are used to provide real world examples and comparisons. This text is intended for a one-semester course, and can be used in a two-semester sequence with the companion text, Microeconomics: Markets, Methods, and Models. The three introductory chapters and the International Trade chapter (Chapter 15) are common to both books.",

As such, it meets the criteria established by the British Columbia Ministry of Education while providing content suitable for adult learners. The goal of the book is to help students develop skills in reading, writing, language use, and study skills.\nThe book is divided into ten units, each of which focuses on a specific theme; these include food, work, art, money, nature, and more. All units follow the same sequence. Within each unit, students encounter two reading passages; these are followed by questions designed to improve comprehension skills, vocabulary, and critical thinking skills. Reading skills sections focus on tasks such as identifying bias, determining author purpose, and making personal connections with the text. Writing skills sections enable students to develop their skills at the paragraph level though such tasks as comparing/contrasting, discussing causes and effects, and writing persuasive pieces; creative writing, blogging, and letter writing are also included. There is work on language use, such as sentence structure, summarizing, paraphrasing, and so on. Study skills are also presented, with guidelines on time management, self-awareness, managing stress, and avoiding academic dishonesty. Where possible, the content is specific to British Columbia, including First Nations peoples. \nThroughout the book, students are encouraged to think critically about the issues presented to them, whether these are related to dietary habits, worker safety, the value of art, or a variety of other topics. Each unit contains several 'Think about It!' activities, where students are encouraged to share their own opinions, either orally or in writing. The goal is that students finish the book with a greater understanding of reading and writing skills; at the same time, they will develop a greater insight into their own opinions on a variety of topics relevant to their lives. \n",

It is also designed as a resource tool for all persons working in the anti-corruption field. The first chapter sets out the general context of global corruption: its nature and extent, and some views on its historical, social, economic and political dimensions. Each subsequent chapter sets out international standards and requirements in respect to combatting corruption \u2014 mainly in the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and the OECD Bribery of Foreign Officials Convention (OECD Convention). The laws of the United States and United Kingdom are then set out as examples of how those Convention standards and requirements are met in two influential jurisdictions. Finally, the law of Canada is set out. Thus, a professor from Africa, Australia, New Zealand or English-speaking countries in Asia and Europe has a nearly complete coursebook \u2014 for example, that professor can delete the Canadian sections of this book and insert the law and practices of his or her home country in their place. While primarily directed to a law school course on global corruption, this book will be of interest and use to professors teaching courses on corruption from other academic disciplines and to lawyers and other anti-corruption practitioners.",

It is intended as a high-school and college-level introduction to the central concepts of narrative theory that will aid students in developing their competence not only in analyzing and interpreting short stories and novels, but also in writing them. Prose Fiction prioritizes clarity over intricacy of theory, equipping its readers with the necessary tools to embark on further study of literature, literary theory and creative writing. Building on a \u201csemiotic model of narrative,\u201d it is structured around the key elements of narratological theory, with chapters on plot, setting, characterisation, and narration, as well as on language and theme. The chapter on language constitutes essential reading for those students unfamiliar with rhetoric, while the chapter on theme draws together significant perspectives from contemporary critical theory (including feminism and postcolonialism).",

Additionally, it gives students a basis for understanding the application of quantitative principles to the chemistry that underlies the entire course. It also aims to center the study of chemistry on the atomic foundation that many will expand upon in a later course covering organic chemistry, easing that transition when the time arrives.\n\nThe second edition has been revised to incorporate clearer, more current, and more dynamic explanations, while maintaining the same organization as the first edition.

It has many analogies drawn from everyday life to help non-science majors appreciate, on their own terms, what our modern exploration of the universe is revealing. Astronomy was written, updated, and reviewed by a broad range of astronomers and astronomy educators in a strong community effort. Astronomy has information and images from the New Horizons exploration of Pluto, the discovery of gravitational waves, the Rosetta Mission to Comet C-G, and many other recent projects in astronomy. The discussion of exoplanets has been updated with recent information\u2014indicating not just individual examples, but trends in what sorts of planets seem to be most common. Black holes receive their own chapter, and the role of supermassive black holes in active galaxies and galaxy evolution is clearly explained.   It is designed to meet scope and sequence requirements of introductory astronomy courses nationwide. Because there are many different ways to teach introductory astronomy, we have made the text as flexible as we could. Math examples are shown in separate sections throughout, so that you can leave out the math or require it as you deem best. Each section of a chapter treats a different aspect of the topic being covered; a number of sections could be omitted in shorter overview courses and can be included where you need more depth.  This book is written to help students understand the big picture rather than get lost in random factoids to memorize. The language is accessible and inviting. Helpful diagrams and summary tables review and encapsulate the ideas being covered. Each chapter contains interactive group activities you can assign to help students work in teams and pool their knowledge.",

For example, mining and its effects are a global issue and we can see how these unfold in BC. A further example is the recent apology to First Nation peoples on the residential school treatment, as similar events occur in the US, Ireland and Australia. Processes of urbanization, a phenomenon which people all over the globe are experiencing, can be seen in Vancouver with our discussion of the city\u2019s development.

This book draws not only on critical qualitative inquiry methods such as interview and observation, but also on theories and sensibilities from creative writing and performance studies, which encourage self-reflection and narrative composition. Concepts from qualitative inquiry studies, which examine everyday life, are combined with approaches to the creation of character and scene to help writers develop engaging narratives that examine chosen subcultures and the author\u2019s position in relation to her research subjects. The book brings together a brief history of first-person qualitative research and writing from the past forty years, examining the evolution of nonfiction and qualitative approaches in relation to the personal essay. A selection of recent student writing in the genre as well as reflective student essays on the experience of conducting research in the classroom is presented in the context of exercises for coursework and beyond. Also explored in detail are guidelines for interviewing and identifying subjects and techniques for creating informed sketches and images that engage the reader. This book provides approaches anyone can use to explore their communities and write about them first-hand.

Recent studies show that only one in four nurses feel confident in caring for dying patients and their families and less than 2% of overall content in nursing textbooks is related to end-of-life care, despite the tremendous growth in palliative and end-of-life care programs across the country. The purpose of this textbook is to provide an indepth look at death and dying in this country, including the vital role of the nurse in assisting patients and families along the journey towards the end of life. There is an emphasis throughout the book on the simple, yet understated value of effective interpersonal communication between the patient and clinician. The text provides a basic foundation of understanding death and dying, including a brief historical examination of some main conceptual models associated with how patients cope with impending loss. An overview of illness trajectories and models of care, such as hospice and palliative care are discussed. Lastly, the latest evidence-based approaches for pain and symptom management, ethical concerns, cultural considerations, care at the time of death, and grief/bereavement are examined. The goal of this text is to foster the necessary skills for nurses to provide compassionate care to individuals who are nearing the end of life and their families. Every chapter contains a \u201cWhat You Should Know\u201d section which highlights and reinforces foundational concepts.\n",

With consideration to the psychology of invention, Bonczek Evory provides students with exercises aimed to make writing in its early stages a form of play that gives way to more enriching insights through revision, embracing the writing of poetry as both a love of language and a tool that enables us to explore ourselves and better understand the world. The volume includes resources for students seeking to publish and build a writing-centered lifestyle or career. Poets featured range in age, subject, and style, and many are connected to colleges in the State University of New York system. Naming the Unnameable promotes an understanding of poetry as a living art of which students are a part, and provides ways for students to involve themselves in the growing contemporary poetry community that thrives in America today.",

        "description": "Literature, the Humanities, and Humanity attempts to make the study of literature more than simply another school subject that students have to take. At a time when all subjects seem to be valued only for their testability, this book tries to show the value of reading and studying literature, even earlier literature. It shows students, some of whom will themselves become teachers, that literature actually has something to say to them. Furthermore, it shows that literature is meant to be enjoyed, that, as the Roman poet Horace (and his Renaissance disciple Sir Philip Sidney) said, the functions of literature are to teach and to delight. The book will also be useful to teachers who want to convey their passion for literature to their students. After an introductory chapter that offers advice on how to read (and teach) literature, the book consists of a series of chapters that examine individual literary works ranging from The Iliad to Charles Dickens\u2019 Bleak House. These chapters can not substitute for reading the actual works. Rather they are intended to help students read those works. They are attempts to demystify the act of reading and to show that these works, whether they are nearly three thousand or less than two hundred years old, still have important things to say to contemporary readers.",

Keith Nicholson, traditionally published for many years is now being released as an open educational resource and part of Lyryx with Open Texts!

It is a relatively advanced introduction to the ideas and techniques of linear algebra targeted for science and engineering students who need to understand not only how to use these methods but also gain insight into why they work.\n\nThe contents have enough flexibility to present a traditional introduction to the subject, or to allow for a more applied course. Chapters 1\u20134 contain a one-semester course for beginners whereas Chapters 5\u20139 contain a second semester course. The textbook is primarily about real linear algebra with complex numbers being mentioned when appropriate (reviewed in Appendix A).",

        "description": "The goal of this textbook is not to make you an expert. True expertise in any field is a years-long endeavor. Here I will survey some of the basic topics of chemistry. This survey should give you enough knowledge to appreciate the impact of chemistry in everyday life and, if necessary, prepare you for additional instruction in chemistry. Throughout each chapter, I present two features that reinforce the theme of the textbook\u2014that chemistry is all around you. The first is a feature titled, appropriately, \u201cChemistry Is Everywhere.\u201d Chemistry Is Everywhere\u201d focuses on the personal hygiene products that you may use every morning: toothpaste, soap, and shampoo, among others. These products are chemicals, aren\u2019t they? Ever wonder about the chemical reactions that they undergo to give you clean and healthy teeth or shiny hair? I will explore some of these chemical reactions in future chapters. But this feature makes it clear that chemistry is, indeed, everywhere. The other feature focuses on chemistry that you likely indulge in every day: eating and drinking. In the \u201cFood and Drink App,\u201d I discuss how the chemistry of the chapter applies to things that you eat and drink every day. Carbonated beverages depend on the behavior of gases, foods contain acids and bases, and we actually eat certain rocks. (Can you guess which rocks without looking ahead?) Cooking, eating, drinking, and metabolism\u2014we are involved with all these chemical processes all the time. These two features allow us to see the things we interact with every day in a new light\u2014as chemistry.",

Some companies purport to be customer centric but they fall short in connecting this concept throughout all functional areas of the business.  While it is important to offer superb customer service, being customer centric is far more than that.  It's about mapping the customer journey to discover customer needs and wants, what's working and what is not, then taking action to improve the customer experience. Customer loyalty is built through providing exceptional customer experiences.  This in turn increases revenues through positive company image, referrals, and increased customer lifetime value.

This thematic approach, informed by pedagogical research, provides students with an introduction to thinking geographically. This text emphasizes depth over breadth by arranging each chapter around a central theme and then exploring that theme in detail as it applies to the particular region. In addition, while chapters are designed to stand alone and be rearranged or eliminated at the instructor\u2019s discretion, the theme of globalization and inequality unites all of the regions discussed. This core focus enables students to draw connections between regions and to better understand the interconnectedness of our world. This text was written with the backward course design model in mind and the content of each chapter was structured around these learning objectives. Because of this backward design focus, the length of each chapter is considerably shorter than most traditional textbooks. The intention is for the instructor to supplement the text with problems, case studies, and news articles and to use the text as a springboard for discussing deeper issues. ",

        "description": "Mastering Strategic Management is designed to enhance student engagement in three innovative ways. The first is through visual adaptations of the key content in the book. It is well documented that many of today\u2019s students are visual learners. To meet students\u2019 wants and needs (and thereby create a much better teaching experience for professors), Mastering Strategic Management contains multiple graphic concept pages in ever section of every chapter of the book. Think of graphic concept pages as almost like info-graphics for key concepts in each section. This feature sets Mastering Strategic Management apart from any strategic management book on the market today. The second way the authors capture student interest through their textbook is by using a real-world company as the running example in each chapter. For example, Chapter 1 in Mastering Strategic Management utilizes Blackberry to harness the conceptual coverage of the chapter in a running, corporate, application to which students will relate. The third inventive way Mastering Strategic Management holds the attention of strategic management students is through the \u201cstrategy at the movies\u201d feature in each chapter that links course concepts with a popular motion picture. The 1st Canadian Edition is an adaptation of Mastering Strategic Managment. Adaptations include Canadian specific content, images, and references, removal of copyright images, and inclusion of PowerPoints, which can be downloaded from the book's appendix.",

        "description": "Knowing Home attempts to capture the creative vision of Indigenous scientific knowledge and technology that is derived from an ecology of a home place. The traditional wisdom component of Indigenous Science\u2014the values and ways of decision-making\u2014assists humans in their relationship with each other, the land and water, and all of creation. Indigenous perspectives have the potential to give insight and guidance to the kind of environmental ethics and deep understanding that we must gain as we attempt to solve the increasingly complex problems of the 21st century. This book provides a window into the vast storehouse of innovations and technologies of the Indigenous peoples who live in Northwestern North America. It is our hope that the Indigenous Science examples, research, and curriculum models will inspire deep reflection regarding the under-representation of Aboriginal students in the sciences. It is intended that the rich examples and cases, combined with the resources listed in the appendices, will enable teachers and students to explore Indigenous Science examples in the classroom, and in addition, support the development of curriculum projects in home places.",

        "description": "Since Indigenous peoples have developed time-proven approaches to sustaining both community and environment, Elders and young people are concerned that this rich legacy of Indigenous Science with its wealth of environmental knowledge and the wisdom of previous generations could disappear if it is not respected, studied and understood by today's children and youth. A perspective where relationships between home place and all other beings that inhabit the earth is vitally important to all residents\u2014both inheritors of ancient Indigenous Knowledge and wisdom, and newcomers who can experience the engagement, joy and promise of science instilled with a sense of place. This book takes a step forward toward preserving and actively using the knowledge, stories, and lessons for today and future generations, and with it a worldview that informs everyday attitudes toward the earth.\n\nKnowing Home: Braiding Indigenous Science with Western Science is far more than a set of research papers or curriculum studies. The project outputs include both, but they are incorporated into a theoretical structure that can provide the methodological basis for future efforts that attempt to develop culturally responsive Indigenous Science curricula in home places. It is not just one or two angels to organize, but multiple interwoven approaches and cases that give this project its exceptional importance. Thus, the project outputs have been organized into two books.\n\nBook 1 provides an overview of why traditional knowledge and wisdom should be included in the science curriculum, a window into the science and technologies of the Indigenous peoples who live in Northwestern North America, Indigenous worldview, culturally responsive teaching strategies and curriculum models, and evaluative techniques. It is intended that the rich examples and cases, combined with the resources listed in the appendices, will enable teachers and students to explore Indigenous Science examples in the classroom; and in addition, support the development of culturally appropriate curriculum projects.",

They will be shown how to approach the problem by a procedure known as \u201cword analysis,\u201d which is roughly comparable to the dissection of an interesting specimen in the biology laboratory.\n\nThe text assumes no previous knowledge of Greek, and does not involve the grammatical study of this language\u2014except for a few basic features of noun and verb formation that will help students to understand the Greek legacy in English. All students will be asked to learn the Greek alphabet. This skill is not absolutely essential for a general knowledge of Greek roots in English.

David Wiley is credited with coining the term \"open pedagogy\" and contrasts this type of assignment with \"disposable assignments\" that have no value once a grade is assigned (more info: http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2975).  Examples include students demonstrate mastery of weekly learning objectives by writing quiz questions that are added to the test bank for next term or students create or revise open educational resources (OER) for their course. \nATTRIBUTION: Open pedagogy description is an adapted version by Amy Hofer.\n",

        "description": "In this book, you will examine the moral and ethical issues that exist within law enforcement. This book will also familiarize you with the basic history, principles, and theories of ethics. These concepts will then be applied to the major components of the criminal justice system: policing, the courts, and corrections. Discussion will focus on personal values, individual responsibility, decision making, discretion, and the structure of accountability. Specific topics covered will include core values, codes of conduct, ethical dilemmas, organizational consequences, liability, and the importance of critical thinking. By the end of this book, you will be able to distinguish and critically debate contemporary ethical issues in law enforcement.",

        "description": "The goal of this text is to present philosophy to newcomers as a living discipline with historical roots. While a few early chapters are historically organized, the goal in the historical chapters is to trace a developmental progression of thought that introduces basic philosophical methods and frames issues that remain relevant today. Later chapters are topically organized. These include philosophy of science and philosophy of mind, areas where philosophy has shown dramatic recent progress. This text concludes with four chapters on ethics, broadly construed. Traditional theories of right action is covered in a third of these. Students are first invited first to think about what is good for themselves and their relationships in a chapter of love and happiness. Next a few meta-ethical issues are considered; namely, whether they are moral truths and if so what makes them so. The end of the ethics sequence addresses social justice, what it is for one\u2019s community to be good. Our sphere of concern expands progressively through these chapters. Our inquiry recapitulates the course of development into moral maturity.\nOver the course of the text, the author has tried to outline the continuity of thought that leads from the historical roots of philosophy to a few of the diverse areas of inquiry that continue to make significant contributions to our understanding of ourselves and the world we live in.",

        "description": "Since the 18th century, the historical study of \u201cIndians,\u201d \u201cNatives,\u201d and \u201cAboriginals\u201d in universities and colleges was contextualized within the story of colonization and growing European influence. Whatever justification might be mustered for that practice, it had real and dire effects: Canadians \u2014 including many Indigenous people \u2014 came to understand Indigenous histories as tangential, small, unimportant, and even a blind alley. This kind of thinking enabled Canadian authorities and citizens to regard Indigenous communities as being \u201cwithout history,\u201d as in, outside of history, which we can agree in modern times is simply untrue, as this book strives to show. The preface introduces you to some of the practices and challenges of Indigenous history, focusing on the nature and quality of sources, innovative historical methodologies, and the leading historiographical trends (that is, what historians are thinking very broadly and what they have studied in the last decade or four). It turns, then, to histories of Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere before ca. 1500. The twelve chapters that follow are arranged under three headings: Commerce and Allies, Engaging Colonialism, and Culture Crisis Change Challenge. And there is a thirteenth chapter that brings us deep enough into the twenty-first century to allow a visit with two of the most important recent developments in Canadian civic life: Idle No More and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Both of these processes arose from the failures of colonialism and the resilience of Indigenous communities. They reveal, therefore, as much about the history of Canada as they do of the historical experiences of Indigenous peoples.",

The key issues in most chapters are analyzed by introducing a numerical example or case study at the outset. Students are introduced immediately to the practice of taking a data set, examining it numerically, plotting it, and again analyzing the material in that form.\n\nThe end-of-chapter problems involve numerical and graphical analysis, and a small number of problems in each chapter involve solving simple linear equations (intersecting straight lines). However, a sufficient number of questions is provided for the student to test understanding of the material without working through that subset of questions.\n\nThis textbook is intended for a one-semester course, and can be used in a two-semester sequence with the companion textbook, Principles of Macroeconomics.

        "description": "This textbook is for workers and students looking for an introduction to injury prevention on the job. It offers an extensive overview of central occupational health and safety (OHS) concepts and practices and provides practical suggestions for health and safety advocacy. Foster and Barnetson bring the field into the twenty-first century by including discussions of how precarious employment, gender, and ill-health can be better handled in Canadian OHS.\n\nAlthough they address the gendered and racialized dimensions of new work processes and structures in contemporary workplaces, Foster and Barnetson contend that the practice of occupational health and safety can only be understood if we acknowledge that workers and employers have conflicting interests. Who identifies what workplace hazards should be controlled is therefore a product of the broader political economy of employment and one that should be well understood by those working in the field.",

        "description": "In Active Calculus Multivariable, we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by students. Where many texts present a general theory of calculus followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand for themselves why calculus is both coherent and true.",

The Toolkit is presented in the form of a (possible) case study, which is based on questions and issues shared by Trades instructors from three BC post-secondary institutions: Camosun College, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, and University of the Fraser Valley. OER Toolkit for Trades Instructors includes a quick reference guide of definitions, summary of a sample course, a step-by-step guide to implementing course revisions and OER adoption, links to external resources, a sample module and a range of best practice examples. Following three phases of an adoption process (Phase  \u2013 Take stock; Phase 2 \u2013 Make a plan; Phase 3 \u2013 Adopt and evaluate), the Toolkit also explores the motivation of the user and why instructors adopt OERs.",

In addition, because no condition or disease has ever been eliminated by just dealing with those with the problem, community psychologists focus their work on prevention. Finally, community psychology shifts the power dynamics so that community members are equal members of the team, as they provide unique points of view about barriers that need to be overcome in working toward social justice. In a sense, this field has many similarities with community organizing, but it\u2019s different in that community psychologists have both research and action skills to evaluate whether or not our interventions actually work. This textbook will show students how to comprehensively analyze, investigate, and address escalating problems of economic inequality, violence, substance abuse, homelessness, poverty, and racism. It will provide students with perspectives and tools to partner with community members and organizations to promote a fair and equitable allocation of resources and opportunities. ",

The problems are motivated with enough detail to follow the assumptions, but are simplified for the purpose of pedagogy.",

        "description": "Active Calculus (2017 edition) may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard first semester college calculus course or as a supplement to a more traditional text. Chapters 1\u20134 address the typical topics for differential calculus, while Chapters 5\u20138 provide the standard topics of integral calculus, including a chapter on differential equations (Chapter 7) and on infinite series (Chapter 8). In Active Calculus, we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by students. We pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand for themselves why calculus is both coherent and true.",

        "description": "The author designed this book for students and professionals  who  want  to  understand  and  apply  basic  meteorological concepts, but who don\u2019t need to derive equations.  To  make  this  book  accessible  to  more  people,  the author converted the equations into algebra.  With algebraic approximations to the atmosphere, you can see the physical meaning of each term and you can plug in numbers to get usable answers.   No previous knowledge of meteorology is needed \u2014 the book starts from the basics.  Your background should include  algebra,  trig,  and  classical  physics.   This book could serve the fields of Atmospheric Science, Meteorology,  Environmental  Science,  Engineering, Air Quality, Climatology, and Geography. Readers like you asked to see solved examples, to enhance your understanding and speed your ability to apply the concepts to your own situations.   To fill this  need,  the author added  \u201cSample  Application\u201d  boxes  for almost every equation in the book.   This book is designed to be both a textbook and a reference.  As a textbook, the end of each chapter includes extensive homework exercises in categories inspired  by  Bloom\u2019s  taxonomy  of  learning  actions: \u201cBroaden  Knowledge  &  Comprehension\u201d;  \u201cApply\u201d; \u201cEvaluate & Analyze\u201d; and \u201cSynthesize\u201d.

Originally published in 1987 by Foris Publications, this was a pioneering work that played a major role in establishing argumentation theory as a discipline. Today, it is as relevant to the field as when it first appeared, with discussions of questions and issues that remain central to the study of argument. It has defined the main approaches to many of those issues and guided the ways in which we might respond to them. From this foundation, it sets the stage for further investigations and emerging research.\n\nThis is a second edition of the book that is corrected and updated by the author, with new prefaces to each chapter.",

        "description": "This book provides an introduction to the study of meaning in human language, from a linguistic perspective. It covers a fairly broad range of topics, including lexical semantics, compositional semantics, and pragmatics. The chapters are organized into six units: (1) Foundational concepts; (2) Word meanings; (3) Implicature (including indirect speech acts); (4) Compositional semantics; (5) Modals, conditionals, and causation; (6) Tense & aspect.\n\nMost of the chapters include exercises which can be used for class discussion and/or homework assignments, and each chapter contains references for additional reading on the topics covered.\n\nAs the title indicates, this book is truly an INTRODUCTION: it provides a solid foundation which will prepare students to take more advanced and specialized courses in semantics and/or pragmatics. It is also intended as a reference for fieldworkers doing primary research on under-documented languages, to help them write grammatical descriptions that deal carefully and clearly with semantic issues. The approach adopted here is largely descriptive and non-formal (or, in some places, semi-formal), although some basic logical notation is introduced. The book is written at a level which should be appropriate for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students. It presupposes some previous coursework in linguistics, but does not presuppose any background in formal logic or set theory.",

We have written a fundamentally different text for principles of economics, based on two premises: Students are motivated to study economics if they see that it relates to their own lives, and students learn best from an inductive approach, in which they are first confronted with a question and then led through the process of how to answer that question.",

This project grew out of a discussion during one of SPARC\u2019s Libraries and OER Forum monthly calls, where a group of librarians from the U.S. and Canada identified a need for better resources to address misconceptions about OER. A team of volunteers developed a poll and distributed it over email lists and social media over a two week period in July 2017. The results were then used to produce this collaboratively written document.\n\nWhile OER Mythbusting is not intended to be a comprehensive catalog of all myths in all contexts, our hope is that it will provide a useful resource for both OER advocates and those seeking to learn more about the topic. We anticipate that this resource will evolve over time, as new myths emerge and old ones fade.",

Clearly educational research is a challenging enterprise; this guidebook is not meant to replace the substantive courses and experiences that a PhD in educational research would provide. Rather, our hope is to provide some straightforward suggestions that could be implemented by OER adopters so as to help them identify what has happened as a result of their OER adoption.

        "description": "The term \u2018capacity building\u2019 has come into common usage in twenty-first century international development. While the term means different things to different people, it is often used to describe an infusion of knowledge or skills to help \u2018build\u2019 a government\u2019s or institution\u2019s ability to address key development challenges. However, like other well intentioned interventions from the industrialized West, such \u2018capacity building\u2019 can have destructive, as well as productive, impacts. This volume problematizes such activities and presents an alternative approach to promoting capacity in development contexts. The volume starts with an exploration of the concept of capacity building and goes on to focus on two examples of capacity promotion for early childhood education, care and development (ECD). The First Nations Partnerships Program (FNPP), an innovative and successful post-secondary education program initiated in 1989 at the request of a large tribal council in northern Canada, led to 10 educational deliveries with diverse Indigenous communities over the subsequent two decades. The second program, launched in 1994 at the request of UNICEF headquarters, focuses on sub-Saharan Africa. While the program encompasses a range of capacity-promoting activities, the central vehicle for this ECD development work is the Early Childhood Development Virtual University (ECDVU), a program created in 2001 and now in transition to African universities. This book describes approaches to capacity promotion that respond to the complexities and possibilities of communities\u2014at local and country levels. These initiatives challenge established developmental narratives in ECD and international development, and in so doing provide alternative ways for scholars and practitioners in ECD, education, and the broad international development field to enhance capacities.",

The media and culture are so much a part of our days that sometimes it is difficult to step back and appreciate and apprehend their great impact on our lives.\nThe book\u2019s title, and the book itself, begin with a focus squarely on media. Think of your typical day. If you are like many people, you wake to a digital alarm clock or perhaps your cell phone. Soon after waking, you likely have a routine that involves some media. Some people immediately check the cell phone for text messages. Others will turn on the computer and check Facebook, email, or websites. Some people read the newspaper. Others listen to music on an iPod or CD. Some people will turn on the television and watch a weather channel, cable news, or Sports Center. Heading to work or class, you may chat on a cell phone or listen to music. Your classes likely employ various types of media from course management software to PowerPoint presentations to DVDs to YouTube. You may return home and relax with video games, television, movies, more Facebook, or music. You connect with friends on campus and beyond with text messages or Facebook. And your day may end as you fall asleep to digital music. Media for most of us are entwined with almost every aspect of life and work. Understanding media will not only help you appreciate the role of media in your life but also help you be a more informed citizen, a more savvy consumer, and a more successful worker. Media influence all those aspects of life as well.\n",

Le deuxi\u00e8me programme, lanc\u00e9 en 1994 \u00e0 la demande du si\u00e8ge de l\u2019UNICEF, met l\u2019accent sur l\u2019Afrique subsaharienne. Alors que le programme inclut toute une gamme d\u2019activit\u00e9s qui concernent la promotion de capacit\u00e9s, le vecteur central pour ce travail de d\u00e9veloppement est l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Virtuelle pour le D\u00e9veloppement de la Petite-Enfance (UVDPE), un programme cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 2001 et maintenant en phase de transition vers les universit\u00e9s africaines. Ce livre d\u00e9crit des approches pour la promotion de capacit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9pondent aux complexit\u00e9s et aux possibilit\u00e9s des communaut\u00e9s \u2013 au niveau local ainsi que national. Ces initiatives d\u00e9fient le discours actuel en ce qui concerne le d\u00e9veloppent dans le cadre du DPE et du d\u00e9veloppement international et, ce faisant, fournit d\u2019autres moyens de renforcer les capacit\u00e9s pour les chercheurs et les professionnels dans le DPE, l\u2019\u00e9ducation, et le vaste domaine du d\u00e9veloppement international.",
